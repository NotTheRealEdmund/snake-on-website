Upload html files to github pages:

After pushing the files to github repo
Go to your repo on github.com
Settings
Scroll down to Github Pages
Under Source choose master branch and save
When you scroll down again, it says that the site is ready to be published at an url
Copy and paste that url and put it in the description of your repo for easier access

VERY IMPORTANT!!
github pages will look for index.html in the parent directory, so you must have an index.html first before redirecting
to any other .html page or static file.
You MUST have an index.html file!!
